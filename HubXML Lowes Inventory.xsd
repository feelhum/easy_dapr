Each time an update file is submitted, a supplier is certifying the stock levels for all SKU’s as of the time of file submission, not only those that are included in the file.  If the available count for a SKU has not changed since the last update, that SKU is not required to be included in the update file.  SKUs that are not included in the file are considered to be recertified at their previously reported level</xs:documentation>

"YES" indicates that the qtyonhand is available to be sold and that stock levels for this product are actively managed and replenished.

"NO" indicates that orders are not currently being accepted for the product, even if the qtyonhand is greater than zero.  This should be a temporary 'stop-sell' situation.  If the product is not expected to be offered for sale in the future it should be changed to a "DELETED" status.

"GUARANTEED" indicates that that availability for the product is guaranteed regardless of the qtyonhand (i.e. stock level / replenishment is not a concern).  

"DISCONTINUED" indicates that there will be no further replenishment of the supply of this product. The SKU can continue to be sold as long as the qtyonhand is greater than zero, but there should be no expectation that a backorder situation could be satisfied for the product.

"DELETED" - SKU is no longer part of the merchant assortment.  Orders for this product are no longer being accepted.
